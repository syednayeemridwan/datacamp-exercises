This contains a compressed snapshot of the contents of the file when the commit happened (blob is short for binary large object, which is a SQL database term for \"may contain data of any kind\"). In the middle commit, report.md and draft.md were changed, so the blobs are shown next to that commit. data/northern.csv didn't change in that commit, so the tree links to the blob from the previous commit.
