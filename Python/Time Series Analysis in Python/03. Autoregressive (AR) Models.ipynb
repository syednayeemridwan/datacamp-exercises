    "There are a few conventions when using the arima_process module that require some explanation. First, these routines were made very generally to handle both AR and MA models. We will cover MA models next, so for now, just ignore the MA part. Second, when inputting the coefficients, you must include the zero-lag coefficient of 1, and the sign of the other coefficients is opposite what we have been using (to be consistent with the time series literature in signal processing). For example, for an AR(1) process with phi = 0.9, the array representing the AR parameters would be `ar = np.array([1, -0.9])`"
